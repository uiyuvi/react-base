# Bowling
Bowling game constructed using TDD approach in React.

## Rules of Bowling:
A game of bowling consists of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler will have two chances to knock down as many pins as possible with their bowling ball.
 
If a bowler is able to knock down all ten pins with their first ball, he is awarded a strike.
 
If the bowler is able to knock down all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. 
 
Bonus points are awarded for both of these, depending on what is scored in the next 2 balls (for a strike) or 1 ball (for a spare). 
 
If the bowler knocks down all 10 pins in the tenth frame, the bowler is allowed to throw 3 balls for that frame. This allows for a potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 points, a perfect game.
